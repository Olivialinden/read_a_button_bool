# README
This project is an embedded system designed to control a LED through a button using FreeRTOS on Stm32 microcontroller board.
There are 3 tasks, StartDefaultTask, StartTask02, StartTask03.StartDefaultTask is default task.tartTask02 is to detect whether the button has been pressed.
StartTask03 is that once the button is pressed, the LED will blink 1 second.

# Hardware Requirements
The following components are required to build the project:

STM32F446 Nucleao-64 board

# Software Requirements
STM32CubeIDE 1.11.2

# Installation
